***NOTES TO INTERVIEWER***

---------Answers to clarifying questions----------

Q: What should I do if invalid input is passed in?
A: You can assume that the input will be valid.

Q: Does capitalization matter?
A: Yes, you the input is case-sensitive. You code should treat "Sainz" and "SAINZ" as two different people.

Q: Does the order of returned data matter?
A: The required return type is a set, and sets are unordered in Python.

Q: What if every driver won at least one race?
A: An empty set should be returned.

Q: Who is Auberon's favorite F1 driver?
A: Yuki Tsunoda.

--------------------------------------------------



---------Hints for struggling candidates----------

- If your candidate struggles with an initial algorithm, encourage them to walk through an example and desrcibe how they would do it using only pen and paper

- If your candidate still has difficulty forming an approach, encourage them to first attempt to return a set of all drivers in the dicitionary, regardless of what position they finished in.

- If your candidate gets an error when they incorrectly try to initialize their set using {}, encourage them to look up how to initialize an empty set in Python.
